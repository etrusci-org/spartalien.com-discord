**W E L C O M E !**

This server is mainly about music, arts, and creativity.
It's meant to be a place where we can chill-out, share our passions, and come up with new ideas.
There's also an insider category with goodies for fans of my work.

Most uf the server's core crew understand/speak english and german. If you speak another language, we'll just use a translator :wink:

Enjoy your stay!

Yours truly,
SPARTALIEN
