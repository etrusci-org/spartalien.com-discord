# Things To Remember

---

Discord's Markdown parsing is slightly different to the standart. Therefore we just ignore some Markdown linting errors.

---

Always preview in Discord first to make sure Markdown is parsed as expected.

For better readability, ...

... we start static texts with a floppy disk emoji followed by a new line, ...
```text
:floppy_disk:

<text_starts_here>
```

... and end them with a new line followed by a dot.
```text
<text_ends_here>

.
```

See files in [/text](./text) for examples.
